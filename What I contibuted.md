Collab Game developed with 3D animation students at Humber College

The role I took on was the team lead for the movement and abilities team. I managed the team making sure they new what had to be done
and when it needs to be done. I also contributed to coding the abilities and anytime that someone on the team couldn't figure out how
to implement something I would help them complete it by sitting down with them and talking about how I might implement the feature and
point out some things that they may be doing wrong whether it was syntax or mathematics. Another one of my responsibilities was to make sure
there was no conflicts in the code when the team merged it together and was ready to push to main/master branch, which was then handled by the
source control team. I was a part of every meeting and collaborated with each necessary team like networking to make sure the abilities where properly
replicated for multiplayer support.
